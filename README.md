# To-Do_List

This is my exercise of The Odin Project's JavaScript section project Todo app.

The design was inspired by Scotty - the top ranked project in the community solution leaderboard.

I wanted to "finish" a big (for me at the time) project instead of making the code clean and structured, so some of the features and files are missing such as Today and Week page sorting by date and webpack.
